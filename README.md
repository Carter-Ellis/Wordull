## 🎮 How to Play

1. The program randomly selects a word from `words.txt`.
2. You have 6 attempts to guess the correct word.
3. After each guess, you’ll get feedback:
   - 🟩 **Green** — the letter is correct and in the right spot.
   - 🟨 **Yellow** — the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
   - (no color) — the letter is not in the word.
4. Keep guessing until you find the word or run out of attempts!
